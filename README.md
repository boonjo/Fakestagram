# Fakestagram
Fake (n): Those who don't follow you back on Insta

## fake_insta.py
Designed to look through your follower and following list and determine which users aren't following you back

## fake_followers.py
Designed to get a list of hashtags to go through on insta and follow accounts that used that hashtag, like and comment the post, and repeat. This process attempts to gain followers by following accounts first, and showing "interactions" with that account could potentially sway the user to follow back. 

This is still incomplete as there's still some complications to fix.
